Untrained personnel present a hazard to themselves and\nthe machine.\nIMPORTANT: Do not operate this machine until you have read all warnings, cautions,\nand instructions.\nCAUTION: The sample programs in this manual have been tested for accuracy,\nbut they are for illustrative purposes only. The programs do not define\ntools, offsets, or materials. They do not describe workholding or other\nfixturing. If you choose to run a sample program on your machine, do\nso in Graphics mode. Always follow safe machining practices when\nyou run an unfamiliar program.\nAll CNC machines present hazards from rotating cutting tools, belts and pulleys, high\nvoltage electricity, noise, and compressed air. When you use CNC machines and their\ncomponents, you must always follow basic safety precautions to reduce the risk of personal\ninjury and mechanical damage.\nThe work area must be adequately illuminated to allow clear view and safe operation of the\nmachine. This includes the operator work area and all areas of the machine that might be\naccessed during maintenance or cleaning. Adequate illumination is the responsibility of the\nuser.\nCutting tools, workholding, workpiece and coolant are beyond the scope and control of\nHaas Automation, Inc. Each of these potential hazards associated with it (sharp edges,\nheavy lifting considerations, chemical composition, etc) and it is the responsibility of the\nuser to take appropriate action (PPE, training, etc).\nCleaning of the machine is required during normal use and prior to maintenance or repair.\nOptional equipment is available to aid cleaning such as washdown hoses, chip conveyors\nand chip augers. Safe use of this equipment requires training and might require appropriate\nPPE and is the responsibility of the user.\nThis operator’s manual is intended as a reference guide and is not to be the sole source of\ntraining. Complete operator training is available from the authorized Haas distributor.\n1",

    "text": "General Safety Notes\n1.1.1 Summary of Types of Operation for Haas Automation\nMachine Tools\nHaas CNC Mills are intended for cutting and shaping of metals and other hard materials.\nThey are general purpose in nature and a list of all of those materials and types of cutting\nwould never be complete. Almost all cutting and shaping is performed by a rotating tool\nmounted in a spindle. Rotation of the mill is not required. Some cutting operations require\nliquid coolant. That coolant is also an option depending on the type of cutting.\nOperations of Haas Mills are separated into three areas. They are: Operations,\nMaintenance, and Service. Operations and Maintenance are intended to be performed by\na trained and qualified machine operator. This Operator's Manual contains some of the\ninformation necessary to operate the machine. All other machine operations are to be\nconsidered Service. Service is only to be performed by specially trained service personnel.\nOperation of this machine consists of the following:\n1. Machine Setup\n• Machine setup is done to initially set up the tools, offsets, and fixtures required\nto perform a repetitive function that later is called machine operation. Some\nmachine setup functions can be done with the door open but are limited to\n“hold to run”.\n2. Machine operating in Automatic Mode\n• Automatic operation is initiated with Cycle-Start and can only be done with the\ndoors closed.\n3. Operator loading and unloading of materials (parts)\n• Parts loading and unloading is what precedes and follows an automatic\noperation. This must be done with the doors open and all machine automatic\nmotion is stopped when the door is open.\n4. Operator loading and unloading of cutting tools\n• Tool loading and unloading is done less often than setup. It is often required\nwhen a tool has become worn and must be replaced.\nMaintenance only consists of the following:\n1. Adding and maintaining condition of coolant\n• Adding coolant and maintaining coolant concentration is required at regular\nintervals. This is a normal operator function and is either done from a safe\nlocation outside of the work enclosure or with the doors open and the machine\nstopped.\n2. Adding lubricants\n2",

    "text": "Safety\n• Adding lubricants for spindle and axes is required at regular intervals. These\nare often months or years in length. This is a normal operator function and is\nalways done from a safe location outside of the work enclosure.\n3. Cleaning chips out of the machine\n• Cleaning out of chips is required at intervals dictated by the type of machining\nperformed. This is a normal operator function. It is performed with the doors\nopen and all of the machine operation is stopped.\nService only consists of the following:\n1. Repairing of a machine that is not operating correctly\n• Any machine that is not operating correctly requires service by factory trained\npersonnel. This is never an operator function. It is not considered\nmaintenance. Installation and service instructions are provided separately\nfrom the Operator’s Manual.\n2. Machine moving, unpacking, and installation\n• Haas machines are shipped to a user’s location almost ready to operate. They\nstill require a trained service person to complete the installation. Installation\nand service instructions are provided separately from the Operator’s Manual.\n3.

Severe injury or death\nmay result. Motion is possible when the power is on and the machine\nis not in [EMERGENCY STOP].\nBasic safety:\n• This machine can cause severe bodily injury.\n• This machine is automatically controlled and may start at any time.\n• Consult your local safety codes and regulations before you operate the machine.\nContact your dealer if you have questions about safety issues.\n• It is the machine owner’s responsibility to make sure that everyone who is involved\nin installing and operating the machine is fully acquainted with the operation and\nsafety instructions provided with the machine, BEFORE they work with the machine.\nThe ultimate responsibility for safety rests with the machine owner and the individuals\nwho work with the machine.\n• Use appropriate eye and ear protection when you operate the machine.\n• Use appropriate gloves to remove processed material and to clean the machine.\n• Replace windows immediately if they are damaged or severely scratched.\n• Keep the side windows locked during operation (if available).\nElectrical safety:\n• The electrical power must meet the required specifications. Attempting to run the\nmachine from any other source can cause severe damage and will void the warranty.\n• The electrical panel should be closed and the key and latches on the control cabinet\nshould be secured at all times, except during installation and service. At those times,\nonly qualified electricians should have access to the panel. When the main circuit\nbreaker is on, there is high voltage throughout the electrical panel (including the\ncircuit boards and logic circuits) and some components operate at high\ntemperatures; therefore, extreme caution is required. Once the machine is installed,\nthe control cabinet must be locked, with the key available only to qualified service\npersonnel.\n• Do not reset a circuit breaker until the reason for the fault is investigated and\nunderstood. Only Haas-trained service personnel should troubleshoot and repair\nHaas equipment.\n• Do not press [POWER UP] on the control pendant before the machine is fully\ninstalled.\nOperation Safety:\n4",

These factors are application specific and are\ncontrolled by the user, not Haas Automation Inc.\n1.2 Unattended Operation\nFully enclosed Haas CNC machines are designed to operate unattended; however, your\nmachining process may not be safe to operate unmonitored.\nAs it is the shop owner’s responsibility to set up the machine safely and use best practice\nmachining techniques, it is also the owner’s responsibility to manage the progress of these\nmethods. You must monitor your machining process to prevent damage, injury, or loss of\nlife if a hazardous condition occurs.\nFor example, if there is the risk of fire due to the material machined, then you must install\nan appropriate fire suppression system to reduce the risk of harm to personnel, equipment,\nand the building. Contact a specialist to install monitoring tools before machines are\nallowed to run unattended.\nIt is especially important to select monitoring equipment that can immediately detect a\nproblem and perform an appropriate action without human intervention.\n1.3 Door Rules - Run / Setup Mode\nAll Haas CNC machines are equipped with locks on the operator doors and a key switch\non the side of the control pendant to lock and unlock setup mode. Generally, setup mode\nstatus (locked or unlocked) affects how the machine operates when the doors are opened.\nSetup mode should be locked out (the keyswitch in the vertical, locked position) at most\ntimes. In Run and in Setup mode, the enclosure doors are locked closed during CNC\nprogram execution, spindle rotation or axis movement. The doors automatically unlock\nwhen the machine is not in cycle. Many machine functions are unavailable with the door\nopen.\nWhen unlocked, setup mode allows a skilled machinist more access to the machine to set\nup jobs. In this mode, machine behavior is dependent on whether the doors are opened or\nclosed. The following charts summarize the modes and allowed functions.\nCAUTION: Haas Robot Package: Care should be taken in Setup mode - Only\ntime Robot can move while cage is open.

While the door is open, the spindle speed is limited to\nthe lower of the factory RPM limit or Setting 292, Door Open Spindle Speed Limit. If the\ndoor is opened while the spindle RPM is above the limit, the spindle will decelerate to the\nlimit RPM. Closing the door removes the limit and the programmed RPM is restored.\nThis open-door condition is allowed only while a robot communicates with the CNC\nmachine. Typically, an interface between the robot and the CNC machine addresses the\nsafety of both machines.\n1.4 Haas Robot Package\nThe Haas designed work cell made up of a CNC machine and a robot has been evaluated\nfor CE compliance. Changes or variations to the Haas cell design should be re-evaluated\nfor compliance to the applicable standards and are the responsibility of the user/integrator.\nRobot is controlled by the CNC it is paired with.

If you have any doubts about your ability to\ncomplete the procedure, contact your Haas Factory Outlet (HFO) for assistance.\n1.8 Improper Coolants\nCoolant is an important part of many machining operations. When it is correctly used and\nmaintained, coolant can improve part finish, lengthen tool life, and protect machine\ncomponents from rust and other damage. Improper coolants, however, can cause\nsignificant damage to your machine.\nSuch damage can void your warranty, but it can also introduce hazardous conditions to\nyour shop. For example, coolant leaks through damaged seals could create a slipping\nhazard.\nImproper coolant use includes, but is not limited to, these points:\n• Do not use plain water. This causes machine components to rust.\n• Do not use flammable coolants.\n• Do not use straight or “neat” mineral-oil products. These products cause damage to\nrubber seals and tubing throughout the machine. If you use a minimum-quantity\nlubrication system for near-dry machining, use only the recommended oils.\nMachine coolant must be water-soluble, synthetic oil-based or synthetic-based coolant or\nlubricant.\nNOTE: Be sure to maintain your coolant mixture to keep the coolant\nconcentrate at acceptable levels. Improperly maintained coolant\nmixtures can allow machine components to rust. Rust damage is not\ncovered by your warranty.\nAsk your HFO or your coolant dealer if you have questions about the specific coolant that\nyou plan to use.\n15",

In your program, you specify\na group of tools instead of a single tool. ATM tracks the tool use in each tool group and\ncompares it to your defined limits.

Press [RECOVER] and follow the directions to reset the tool changer.\n4.13.3 SMTC Programming Notes\nTool Pre-Call\nTo save time, the control looks ahead as far as 80 lines into your program to process and\nprepare machine motion and tool changes. When look-ahead finds a tool change, the\ncontrol puts the next tool in your program into position. This is called “tool pre-call.”\nSome program commands stop look-ahead. If your program has these commands before\nthe next tool change, the control does not pre-call the next tool. This can cause your\nprogram to run slower, because the machine must wait for the next tool to move into\nposition before it can change tools.\nProgram commands that stop look-ahead:\n• Work offset selections ( , , etc.)\nG54 G55\n• Limit Block Buffering, when programmed without a address or with a nonzero\nG103 P\naddress\nP\n• Optional Stop\nM01\n• Stop Program\nM00\n150",

The M50 (execute pallet\nchange) function consists of unlocking, lifting and rotating the pallets, then lowering and\nlocking the pallets again. The pallet changer rotates the pallets 180°, then back; it does not\ncontinuously rotate in the same direction.\nThe pallet changer is provided with an audible signaling device to alert nearby personnel\nwhen a pallet change is taking place. However, do not depend on the signal to avoid\nmishaps.\n4.14.1 Pallet Changer Warnings and Cautions\n• Large workpieces may collide into frame during a pallet change.\n• Verify tool length clearance during pallet changes.

Normally, cutter compensation\nis programmed to shift the tool in order to control feature size. The offset display is used to\nenter the amount that the tool is to be shifted. The offset can be entered as either a diameter\nor radius value, depending on Setting 40, for both the geometry and wear values. If\ndiameter is specified, the shift amount is half of the value entered. The effective offset\nvalues are the sum of the geometry and wear values. Cutter compensation is only available\nin the X Axis and the Y Axis for 2D machining ( ). For 3D machining, cutter\nG17\ncompensation is available in the X Axis, Y Axis, and Z Axis ( ).\nG141\n199",

However, it will look ahead at the next\n(2) blocks that have X or Y motions. The control checks these (3) blocks of information for\ninterference. Setting 58 controls how this part of cutter compensation works. Available\nSetting 58 values are Fanuc or Yasnac.\nIf Setting 58 is set to Yasnac, the control must be able to position the side of the tool along\nall of the edges of the programmed contour without overcutting the next two motions. A\ncircular motion joins all of the outside angles.\nIf Setting 58 is set to Fanuc, the control does not require that the tool cutting edge be placed\nalong all edges of the programmed contour, preventing overcutting. However the control\nwill generate an alarm if the cutter’s path is programmed so that it will overcut. The control\njoins outside angles less than or equal to 270 degrees with a sharp corner. It joins outside\nangles of more than 270 degrees with an extra linear motion.\nThese diagrams show how cutter compensation works for the possible values of Setting\n58. Note that a small cut of less than the tool radius and at a right angle to the previous\nmotion will work only with the Fanuc setting.\n200",

    "text": "Programming\n5.7.2 Entry and Exit from Cutter Compensation\nWhen entering and exiting cutter compensation, or when changing from left side to right\nside compensation, there are special considerations to be aware of. Cutting should not be\nperformed during any of these moves. To activate cutter compensation, a nonzero code\nD\nmust be specified with either or and must be specified in the line that cancels\nG41 G42 G40\ncutter compensation. In the block that turns on cutter compensation, the starting position of\nthe move is the same as the programmed position, but the ending position will be offset, to\neither the left or right of the programmed path, by the amount entered in the,\nradius/diameter, offset column.\nIn the block that turns off cutter compensation, the starting point is offset and the ending\npoint is not offset. Similarly, when changing from left to right or right to left side\ncompensation, the starting point of the move needed to change cutter compensation\ndirection will be offset to one side of the programmed path and end at a point that is offset\nto the opposite side of the programmed path. The result of all this is that the tool moves\nthrough a path that may not be the same as the intended path or direction.\nIf cutter compensation is turned on or off in a block without any X-Y move, there is no\nchange made to cutter compensation until the next X or Y move is encountered. To exit\nfrom cutter compensation, you must specify .\nG40\nYou should always turn off cutter compensation in a move that clears the tool away from\nthe part being cut. If a program is terminated with cutter compensation still active, an alarm\nis generated. In addition, you cannot turn cutter compensation on or off during a circular\nmove ( or ); otherwise an alarm will be generated.\nG02 G03\nAn offset selection of will use zero as the offset value and have the same effect as\nD0\nturning off cutter compensation. If a new value is selected while cutter compensation is\nD\nalready active, the new value will take effect at the end of the proceeding move. You cannot\nchange the value or change sides during a circular motion block.\nD\nWhen turning on cutter compensation in a move that is followed by a second move at an\nangle of less than 90 degrees, there are two ways of computing the first motion: cutter\ncompensation type A and type B (Setting 43). Type A is the default in Setting 43 and is what\nis normally needed; the tool moves directly to the offset start point for the second cut. Type\nB is used when clearance around a fixture of clamp is needed, or in rare cases when part\ngeometry demands it. The diagrams in this section illustrate the differences between type\nA and type B for both Fanuc and Yasnac settings (Setting ).\n58\n203",

A cutter compensation\nalarm will be generated if the machine is set to the Yasnac setting.\n5.7.3 Feed Adjustments in Cutter Compensation\nWhen using cutter compensation in circular moves, there is the possibility of speed\nadjustments to what has been programmed. If the intended finish cut is on the inside of a\ncircular motion, the tool should be slowed down to ensure that the surface feed does not\nexceed what was intended by the programmer. There are problems, however, when the\nspeed is slowed by too much. For this reason, Setting is used to limit the amount by\n44\nwhich the feed is adjusted in this case. It can be set between 1% and 100%. If set to 100%,\nthere will be no speed changes. If set to 1%, the speed can be slowed to 1% of the\nprogrammed feed.\nWhen the cut is on the outside of a circular motion, there is no speed-up adjustment made\nto the feed rate.\n204",

The circle section illustration will describe the\nI J\ndifferent sections of a circle.\nBy using cutter compensation in this section, the programmer will be able to shift the cutter\nby an exact amount and be able to machine a profile or a contour to the exact print\ndimensions. By using cutter compensation, programming time and the likelihood of a\nprogramming calculation error is reduced due to the fact that real dimensions can be\nprogrammed, and part size and geometry can be easily controlled.\n206",

    "text": "Programming\nHere are a few rules about cutter compensation that you must follow closely for successful\nmachining operations. Always refer to these rules when you write your programs.\n1. Cutter compensation must be turned ON during a move that is equal to or\nG01 X,Y\ngreater than the cutter radius, or the amount being compensated.\n2. When an operation using cutter compensation is done, the cutter compensation will\nneed to be turned OFF, using the same rules as the turn ON process, i.e., what is put\nin must be taken out.\n3. In most machines, during cutter compensation, a linear X,Y move that is smaller than\nthe cutter radius may not work. (Setting - set to Fanuc - for positive results.)\n58\n4.

The control\nuses the MRZP for Tool Center Point Control (TCPC) and Dynamic Work Offsets (DWO)\nfor 4th- and 5th-axis machining. MRZP uses Settings 255, 256, and 257 to define the zero\npoint.\n255 – Machine Rotary Zero Point X Offset\n256 – Machine Rotary Zero Point Y Offset\n257 – Machine Rotary Zero Point Z Offset\nThe value stored in each of these settings is the distance from the home position of a linear\naxis to the center of rotation of a rotary axis. The units are in current machine units (as\ndefined by Setting 9).\nNOTE: In machines with built-in 4th and 5th axes, such as the UMC-750, the\ninitial MRZP offsets are set at the factory. You do not have to set initial\nvalues for these machines.\nYou do the MRZP adjustment procedures when:\n• You install a new rotary unit in a mill, and you want to use TCPC/DWO.\n• The machine has been crashed.\n• The machine’s level has changed.\n• You want to make sure that the MRZP settings are correct.\nMRZP adjustment consists of (2) stages: rough and finish. The rough stage establishes\nMRZP values that the control uses for the finish stage. Generally, you do the rough stage\nonly at new installations, or when you are not sure if the current MRZP settings are close\nenough to correct for the finish set procedure.\nBoth the rough and finish MRZP procedures use the work probe to generate values in\nmacro variables, which you then transfer to the correct settings. You must change the\nvalues manually because the setting values cannot be set via macro. This protects them\nfrom accidental change in the middle of a program.\n240",

If Setting 28 is , the canned cycle executes in the same\nOFF\nblock only if you command an X/Y position in that block.\n• If Setting 28 is , and you command a canned cycle G-code with or without an X/Y\nON\nposition in the same block, the canned cycle executes in that block—either at the\nposition where you commanded the canned cycle, or at the new X/Y position.\n• If you include a loop count of zero ( ) in the same block as the canned cycle\nL0\nG-code, the canned cycle does not execute in that block. The canned cycle does not\nexecute regardless of Setting 28 and whether or not the block also contains an X/Y\nposition.\nNOTE: Unless otherwise noted, the program examples given here assume\nthat Setting 28 is .\nON\nWhen a canned cycle is active, it repeats at every new X/Y position in the program. In the\nexample above, with each incremental move of -0.5625 in the X axis, the canned cycle\n( ) drills a 0.5\" deep hole. The address code in the incremental position command\nG81 L\n( ) repeats this operation (9) times.\nG91\nCanned cycles operate differently depending on whether incremental ( ) or absolute\nG91\n( ) positioning is active. Incremental motion in a canned cycle is often useful, because\nG90\nit lets you use a loop ( ) count to repeat the operation with an incremental X or Y move\nL\nbetween cycles.\nExample:\n%\nX1.25 Y-0.75 (center location of bolt hole pattern) ;\nG81 G99 Z-0.5 R0.1 F6.5 L0;\n(L0 on the G81 line will not drill a hole) ;\nG70 I0.75 J10. L6 (6-hole bolt hole circle) ;\n%\nThe R plane value and the Z depth value are important canned cycle address codes. If you\nspecify these addresses in a block with XY commands, the control does the XY move, and\nit does all of the subsequent canned cycles with the new R or Z value.\nThe X and Y positioning in a canned cycle is done with rapid moves.\nand change the way the canned cycles operate. When is active, the Z-Axis\nG98 G99 G98\nwill return to the initial start plane at the completion of each hole in the canned cycle.

This is a good way to avoid obstacles in the X/Y plane.\nConsider a 6\" square aluminum block, with a 1\" by 1\" deep flange on each side. The print\ncalls for two holes centered on each side of the flange. You use a canned cycle to\nG81\nmake the holes. If you simply command the hole positions in the drill canned cycle, the\ncontrol takes the shortest path to the next hole position, which puts the tool through the\ncorner of the workpiece. To prevent this, command a position past the corner, so the move\nto the next hole position does not go through the corner. The drill canned cycle is active,\nbut you do not want a drill cycle at that position, so use in this block.\nL0\nF7.3: Canned Cycle Obstacle Avoidance.

    "text": "Introduction\nThread milling notes:\nInternal holes smaller than 3/8 inch may not be possible or practical. Always climb cut the\ncutter.\nUse a to cut I.D. threads or a to cut O.D. threads. An I.D. right hand thread will\nG03 G02\nmove up in the Z-Axis by the amount of one thread pitch. An O.D. right hand thread will\nmove down in the Z-Axis by the amount of one thread pitch. PITCH = 1/Threads per inch\n(Example - 1.0 divided by 8 TPI = .125)\nThis program I.D. thread mills a 1.5 diameter x 8 TPI hole with a 0.750\" diameter x 1.0\"\nthread hob.\n1. To start, take the hole diameter (1.500). Subtract the cutter diameter .750 and then\ndivide by 2. (1.500 - .75) / 2 = .375\nThe result (.375) is the distance the cutter starts from the I.D. of the part.\n2. After the initial positioning, the next step of the program is to turn on cutter\ncompensation and move to the I.D. of the circle.\n3. The next step is to program a complete circle ( or ) with a Z-Axis command\nG02 G03\nof the amount of one full pitch of the thread (this is called Helical Interpolation).\n4. The last step is to move away from the I.D. of the circle and turn off cutter\ncompensation.\nYou cannot turn cutter compensation off or on during an arc movement. You must program\na linear move, either in the X or Y Axis, to move the tool to and from the diameter to cut.\nThis move will be the maximum compensation amount that you can adjust.\nThread Milling Example\nF7.8: Thread Milling Example, 1.5 Diameter X 8 TPI: [1]Tool Path, [2] Turn on and off cutter\ncompensation.\nI.D.

    "text": "Introduction\nM138 / M139 Spindle Speed Variation On/Off\nSpindle Speed Variation (SSV) lets you specify a range within which the spindle speed\ncontinuously varies. This is helpful in suppressing tool chatter, which can lead to an\nundesirable part finish and/or damage to the cutting tool. The control varies the spindle\nspeed based on Settings 165 and 166. For example, to vary spindle speed +/- 100 RPM\nfrom its current commanded speed with a duty cycle of 1 seconds, set Setting 165 to 100\nand Setting 166 to 1.\nThe variation you use depends on the material, tooling, and the characteristics of you\napplication, but 100 RPM over 1 second is a good starting point.\nYou can override the values of settings 165 and 166 using P and E address codes when\nused with M138. Where P is SSV Variation (RPM) and E is the SSV Cycle (Sec). See\nexample below:\nM138 P500 E1.5 (Turn SSV On, vary the speed by 500 RPM, cycle\nevery 1.5 seconds);\nM138 P500(Turn SSV on, vary the speed by 500, cycle based on\nsetting 166);\nM138 E1.5 (Turn SSV on, vary the speed by setting 165, cycle\nevery 1.5 seconds);\nNOTE: If you have an M138 Enn on one line and a G187 Enn on another line,\nthe E codes would be unique to the line they are on. The Enn Code for\nthe G187 would apply to G187 only and not affect the active SSV\nbehavior.\nM138 is independent of spindle commands; once commanded, it is active even when the\nspindle is not turning. Also, M138 remains active until canceled with M139, or at M30,\nReset, or Emergency Stop.\nM140 MQL On Continuous Mode / M141 MQL On Single\nSquirt Mode / M142 Stop MQL\nturns the Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) option on, and turns it off.\nM140 M142 M141\nturns on the MQL on for the specified time, then turns it off.\n434",

This means that the control keeps the radii of corners no bigger than\n0.0250\".\nSetting 85 causes the control to adjust feeds around corners in all 3 axes to meet the\ntolerance value. The lower the value of Setting 85, the slower the control feeds around\ncorners to meet the tolerance. The higher the value of Setting 85, the faster the control\nfeeds around corners, up to the commanded feedrate, but it could round the corner off to a\nradius up to the tolerance value.\nNOTE: The angle of the corner also affects the change to the feedrate. The\ncontrol can cut shallow corners within tolerance at a higher feedrate\nthan it can with tighter corners.\nF9.6: The control can cut corner [1] within tolerance at a higher feedrate than it can cut corner\n[2].\n1\n2\nIf Setting 85 has a value of zero, the control acts as if exact stop is active in each motion\nblock.\nRefer also to Setting 191 on page 470 and on page 395.\nG187\n462",

Output requested by one\nconnection is sent to all connections.\n1. In the basic options section, type the machine’s IP address and the port number in\nSetting 143. Setting 143 must have a nonzero value to use MDC.\n2. Select the Raw or Telnet connection type.\n3. Click “Open” to start the connection.\n513",

Successful queries return the\nname of the query, then the requested information, separated by commas. For example, a\nquery of returns MODEL, XXX, where XXX is the machine model. The comma lets\n?Q102\nyou treat the output as comma-separated variable (CSV) data.\nAn unrecognized command returns a question mark followed by the unrecognized\ncommand; for example, ?Q105 returns ?, ?Q105 .\nE Commands (Write to Variable)\nYou can use an E command to write to any writable macro variable, but we suggest only\nwriting to variables #1-33 and #10000-#10999, as values outside this range are set aside\nfor other purposes.\n515",
